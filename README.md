# SelfDrivingSimulation

#This model runs on the open-source Self-driving car simulator provided by Udacity that is used in their Self-driving car Nano degree program as I wasnt able to connect it to the carla server and thought it would be better to learn how to steer before trying to tackle and obstacle based course. 

#This was an attempt to implement the paper published by NVIDIA as attatched in the folder.

#The Utilis python file contains all the dependencies and function related to image preprocessing and others.

#The TrainingSimulation file contains the steps taken to run the code.

#The TestSimulation file connects the model to the unity game server and runs the model on the car available in the game engine.
